We have implemneted a compiler that can read a traffic light input.txt file, outputs 1 and 0 according to the light algoritme.

To use our program, you need to run it form terminal.
1. First change direction to our file folder. 
2. Then you have 3 options:
    1. Type: "make" to run our program on the traffic light input file.
    2. Type: "make grun" to run our grun tree on the traffic light input file
    3. Type: "make hellogrun" to run our grun tree on our helloworld input file.
